# Welcome... 

If you've stumbled across this site it's probably because you've been looking for something ACI related, or you've seen one of my presentations from Cisco Live or some other event.

I put this page together for a couple of reasons, firstly because I've pulled together so many best practices for different customers that I thought I should consolidate them in one place, and secondly because I sometimes forget how I've done things :)

## A little about me...

I've been at Cisco for longer than I can remember, I guess the ability to change roles and do different things is what's kept me here at Cisco. I'm based in the UK and currently work as a Global Solutions Architect in Cisco's Data Center Networking team, prior to working in the Global team I've worked for both the EMEA and UK Systems Engineering teams.

Outside of work I love to travel and go diving whenever I get the chance.

According to my kids I draw pictures for a job, which is partially true .... I do love a diagram...!
